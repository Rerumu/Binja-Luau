A Binary Ninja architecture plugin for dealing with Luau files.

To install, simply build via `cargo build` (or `cargo build --release`) and place the resulting library in the plugin directory.

You should then be able to open Luau bytecode files (the kind generated by `luau --compile=binary`) within Binary Ninja and inspect their contents.
